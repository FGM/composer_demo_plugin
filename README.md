# composer_demo_plugin

This project contains a Composer demo plugin showing all composer events, as documented on https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/plugins.md

Its purpose is to help gain an understanding of which events are fired in which situations,
as a means to replace many Composer hook scripts in `composer.json` by automatically triggered
plugins, as a way to increase projects resiliency.
